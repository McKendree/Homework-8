# Homework-8 p1
Run hwk8_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk8_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py. This will print and save the figure "Buckingham_potential.png". It will also attempt to print the maximum value of the function as found using scipy, though this part of the code is untested because I could not get scipy to work.

# Homework-8 p2
Run hwk8_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk8_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py. This will print and save the figure "function_graph.png", which is the answer to part a) of the problem. The answer to part c) will also print, but the piece of code that prints the answer to part b) has been commented out because I do not expect it to work, though I cannot test it due to scipy not working for me.
